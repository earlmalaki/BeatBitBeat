## Game Overview

Beat Bit Beat ® is an addictive PvP music game that fuses the rush of a rhythm oriented and the challenge of an action oriented game, feeding the adrenaline junkies with their much needed adrenaline. This game got its inspiration from the movie “Scott Pilgrim vs The World (2010)”.


The goal of Beat Bit Beat ® is to eliminate the opposing player’s monster by casting skills, which are made available through the collection of the falling bit notes. The players must collect the bit notes in order to avail the skills that will be casted by their monster to attack the opponent’s monster. Players can pick their monsters before each encounter. Each monster will have unique skills and attributes.


Each round will last the duration of the song, but will end as soon as one of the player’s HP reaches zero. The collected bit notes will serve as the resource that will be spent on every cast of skill. The player will have four different active skills to choose from.


## Game Mechanics / Gameplay


The envisioned Game is a combination Rhythm and Action/Fighting genre. It combines two different core gameplays/mechanics that would later interplay with each other to produce a new feel to both genre.


### Overview of Mechanics


#### Rhythm Mechanics:
	
game.Note System: The Timing of the drop of the notes with respect to the music, and the track to which vertical line the note will spawn.

BarTime System: The Timing of the keys pressed by the player when the notes      dropped reach the bar line to hit the key.

Resource System: The counter to the resources(notes) acquired by the player to be used in relation to Action/Fighting Mechanics.

Time System: The time that would determine the length of the round. To be used in relation to the action/fighting mechanics.


#### Action/Fighting Mechanics:

Resource System: The resources(notes) collected on the rhythm mechanics will be used as energy the character can use to attack the opponent.

Attack System: The different attack/skills a unique character can use when the required resource/energy is met.

Health System: The amount of health a character can sustain till defeated. End of round. Also serves as gauge as to whoever has more health left when the time runs out.

Time System: Works in relation with the rhythm mechanics. Serves as the length of the round.


## Overview of Gameplay

### Selection Screen:

The game is to be played by two players. At the start of the game, both players would need to choose the character they want to play. Each Character has his own unique skills but balanced relative to each other. After choosing their respective characters, they would need to agree on what music to play.

### Battle Screen:

Here is where the competition starts. There would be a countdown to three then the music would start. Horizontal bars (bit notes) slide down in sync with the chosen music. The players would need to time and hit the notes. If the player becomes successful in hitting the note, the note becomes converted to a resource/energy the monster can use to attack.     

Victory is awarded to whoever Beat his opponent first using the bit notes in sync with the beat. When the two players still have HP left after the song has finished, victory will be awarded to the player who has more HP.
